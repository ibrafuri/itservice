  <h1>What is cyber security?</h1>
  <h5>Cybersecurity is crucial for protecting personal data, business information, intellectual property, and critical infrastructure from cyber threats such as hacking, ransomware, phishing, and data breaches.</h5>

    </p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, damage, and theft. Its goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and resources in cyberspace.
        <p>
        Key aspects of cybersecurity:
        </p>
           1. Confidentiality: Ensuring that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals.
    </p>
           2. Integrity: Protecting data from being altered or tampered with.
</p>
          3. Availability: Ensuring that systems and data are accessible when needed by authorized users.
<p>
        Common cybersecurity measures:
</p>
            . Firewalls: Filtering network traffic to block unauthorized access.
</p>
            . Encryption: Encoding data to make it unreadable to unauthorized users.
</P>
            . Antivirus Software: Detecting and preventing malicious software (malware).
        </P>
            Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Monitoring for suspicious activity in networks.
        </P>
            Authentication and Authorization: Ensuring users are who they claim to be and have the right level of access.
        </P>
        Cybersecurity is crucial for protecting personal data, business information, intellectual property, and critical infrastructure from cyber threats such as hacking, ransomware, phishing, and data breaches

    </P>Cyber security is important because smartphones, computers and the internet are now such a fundamental part of modern life, that it's difficult to imagine how we'd function without them. From online banking and shopping, to email and social media, it's more important than ever to take steps that can prevent cyber criminals getting hold of our accounts, data, and devices. </p>
