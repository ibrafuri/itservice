      <h3>What does the a Central Processing Unit (CPU)do?</h3>
    <p> A CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the primary component of a computer responsible for carrying out instructions from programs or applications. It is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer because it performs the essential calculations and data processing that allow software to function.
      </P>
        Here’s a breakdown of what the CPU does and how it works:
      <P>
        1. Core Functions of a CPU
      </P>
            Fetch: The CPU retrieves instructions from the system’s memory (RAM).
            Decode: It interprets what the instruction is, translating it into a form it can process.
            Execute: The CPU carries out the instruction, which could involve performing arithmetic, comparing values, or moving data.
        <P>
        2. Components and Architecture
      </P>
            Transistors: Billions of tiny switches called transistors are packed onto a CPU chip. These transistors allow the CPU to process binary code (1s and 0s), which underlies all digital operations.
            Multiple Cores: Modern CPUs often contain multiple cores, meaning they can handle several instructions at once (parallel processing). Each core can function as a mini-CPU, improving multitasking and overall performance.
          <P>
        3. Technologies in Modern CPUs
      </P>
            Multithreading: CPUs with simultaneous multithreading (SMT) or hyper-threading allow each physical core to manage two threads (lines of execution), effectively doubling the number of tasks it can work on at once.
            Clock Speed: Measured in gigahertz (GHz), clock speed refers to how many instructions a CPU can process per second. While higher clock speeds can improve performance within the same CPU family, newer processors tend to be more efficient, so performance isn’t solely determined by speed.
          <P>
        4. CPU’s Role in the System
      </P>
            The CPU is part of a larger system, working in conjunction with other components like memory (RAM), storage, and the graphics card. While the CPU performs general-purpose processing tasks, the memory stores data temporarily, and the GPU handles graphics-intensive tasks like rendering images and videos.
          <P>
        5. Use Cases
      </P>
            CPUs execute everything from simple arithmetic in spreadsheets to rendering complex graphics in video games. Whether you’re running an operating system, watching a video, or managing large datasets, the CPU is central to the operation of any computing device.
          </P>
        In essence, the CPU is a versatile processor capable of handling all the computations needed by software, efficiently managing everything from everyday applications to complex computational tasks.</p>

                       <h3>What does the motherboard do?</h3>
                       <p> Think of a motherboard like the nervous system of a computer. It's a big circuit board that connects all the parts of your computer together, like the CPU (the brain), RAM (the short-term memory), storage drives (where you keep your files), and other components like graphics cards, sound cards, and network cards. The motherboard manages communication between all these parts, making sure they work together smoothly so your computer can run properly. It's like the central hub that keeps everything connected and working together harmoniously.
                        <p>
                        Motherboards come in various shapes and sizes, designed to fit different types of computers and serve different purposes. Here are some common types:
                       <p>
                       ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended): This is the most common type of motherboard found in desktop computers. It offers a standard size and layout, with ample space for expansion slots and connectors.
                       Micro ATX: Micro ATX motherboards are smaller versions of ATX boards, designed to fit in smaller computer cases while still offering decent expansion capabilities.
                       Mini ITX: Mini ITX motherboards are even smaller than Micro ATX boards, making them suitable for compact desktop computers or home theater PCs (HTPCs). They have fewer expansion slots but are great for building smaller, more portable systems.
                       <p>
        Socket Compatibility: Motherboards have a specific CPU socket where the processor is installed. Ensuring that the motherboard's socket matches the CPU socket is crucial. If they don't match, the CPU physically won't fit into the motherboard. For example, an LGA 1151 CPU won't fit into an AM4 socket motherboard.</p>
